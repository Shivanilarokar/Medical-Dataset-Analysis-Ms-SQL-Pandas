# Healthcare Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Healthcare Data Analysis project! This project aims to analyze patient medical records to identify trends and opportunities for improving care. By exploring real-world data on hospitalizations, medical exams, and patient data, we seek to better understand patient needs and health system performance. The primary goal is to showcase the value of data analysis in driving healthcare improvements.

## Project Objectives

The project focuses on achieving the following objectives:

1. **Average Charges by Hospital Tier in 2000:**
   Explored and analyzed the average charges by hospital tier in the year 2000 to understood the financial dynamics across different tiers.

2. **Top 3 Customers with Highest Average Yearly Charges:**
   Identified and analyzed the top three customers with the highest average yearly charges to gain insights into high-value patient demographics.

3. **Smoking Patients with Transplants Analysis:**
   Investigated and analyzed data on smoking patients who have undergone transplants to assess the impact and outcomes of transplant procedures.

4. **Patients with the Highest Charges and City Tier by Year:**
   Identified  and tracked patients with the highest charges, considering the city tier, to observe trends and patterns over the years.

5. **Patients with Major Surgeries or Cancer History:**
   Analyzed data on patients with a history of major surgeries or cancer to understand their healthcare needs and potential challenges.

6. **Patients with Most Major Surgeries:**
   Identified and analyze patients who have undergone the most major surgeries to assess the healthcare utilization patterns.

7. **High BMI Patients with Health Issues:**
   Explored and analyzed data on patients with a high BMI (Body Mass Index) to understand their health issues and associated challenges.

8. **Peak Year for Hospitalizations:**
   Determined the peak year for hospitalizations based on the provided data to understand trends in healthcare demand.

9. **Additional Insights:**
   - The average hospital charge per admission across all patients is $13,559.
   - Patients with higher-than-average charges may warrant additional case management to optimize their care.
   - Segmenting average charges by disease type or patient attributes could provide further insights into cost drivers.

   **Top 3 Customers with Highest Average Yearly Charges:**
   - Ms. Kelly Hawks had the highest average yearly hospital charges at $63,770, followed by Mr. Matthew Lehner at $62,592 and Mr. Phil Lu at $60,021.
   - The top 3 customers with the highest utilization incur 5-10x more in average yearly hospital charges compared to typical customers.
   - Focusing care management resources on the top tier of high-cost customers could help address their health issues and reduce overall spending growth.

   **Smoking Patients with Transplants Analysis:**
   - 26 high-risk patients were identified who smoke, had transplants, and were hospitalized, incurring over $800K in charges.
   - The BMI for this cohort ranges from 17.3 to 52.6, with an average BMI of 34.5, indicating many are obese.
   - Targeted smoking cessation and weight management programs could potentially improve health outcomes and reduce costs.

   **Patients with Health Issues and BMI > 30:**
   - 488 patients with health issues and a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 30, along with associated hospitalization charges.
   - Customers with obesity and health problems tend to have greater healthcare utilization and costs.
   - Proactive outreach to these high-risk individuals could help address their issues through lifestyle changes or disease management.

   **Patients with Major Surgeries or Cancer History:**
   - 687 patients were identified as having 2+ major surgeries or cancer history, indicating complex medical needs.
   - These individuals likely require more intensive care coordination and management due to their conditions.
   - Tailored care plans for patients with surgical/cancer histories can optimize their health outcomes.
